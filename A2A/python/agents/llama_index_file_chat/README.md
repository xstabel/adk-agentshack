# LlamaIndex File Chat Workflow with A2A Protocol

This sample demonstrates a conversational agent built with [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/workflows/) and exposed through the A2A protocol. It showcases file upload and parsing, conversational interactions with support for multi-turn dialogue, streaming responses/updates, and in-line citations.

## How It Works

This agent uses LlamaIndex Workflows with Google Gemini to provide a conversational agent that can upload files, parse them, and answer questions about the content. The A2A protocol enables standardized interaction with the agent, allowing clients to send requests and receive real-time updates.

        Server-->>Client: Stream status update
    end

    Workflow-->>Server: Stream LogEvent about chat processing
    Server-->>Client: Stream status update
    
    Workflow->>Services: LLM Chat (with document context if available)
    Services->>Workflow: Structured LLM Response
    Workflow-->>Server: Stream LogEvent about response processing
    Server-->>Client: Stream status update
    
    Workflow->>Server: Return final ChatResponseEvent
    Server->>Client: Return response with citations (if available)

    Note over Server: Context is maintained for follow-up questions
```

## Key Features

- **File Upload**: Clients can upload files and parse them to provide context to the chat
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Agent can request additional information when needed
- **Real-time Streaming**: Provides status updates during processing
- **Push Notifications**: Support for webhook-based notifications
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context across interactions in the same session
- **LlamaParse Integration**: Uses LlamaParse to parse files accurately

**NOTE:** This sample agent accepts multimodal inputs, but at the time of writing, the sample UI only supports text inputs. The UI will become multimodal in the future to handle this and other use cases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Access to an LLM and API Key (Current code assumes using Google GenAI API)
- A LlamaParse API key ([get one for free](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai))

## Setup & Running

1. Navigate to the samples directory:

   ```bash
   cd python/agents/llama_index_file_chat
   ```

2. Create an environment file with your API keys:

   ```bash
   echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
   echo "LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
   ```

3. Run the agent:

   ```bash
   # Basic run on default port 10010
   uv run .

   # On custom host/port
   uv run . --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

4. In a separate terminal, run an A2A [client](/python/hosts/README.md):

   ```bash
   cd python/hosts/cli
   uv run . --agent http://localhost:10010
   ```

   Download a file to parse, or link to your own file. For example:

   ```bash
   wget https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762 -O attention.pdf
   ```

   And enter something like the following:

   ```bash
   ======= Agent Card ========
   {"name":"Parse and Chat","description":"Parses a file and then chats with a user using the parsed content as context.","url":"http://localhost:10010/","version":"1.0.0","capabilities":{"streaming":true,"pushNotifications":true,"stateTransitionHistory":false},"defaultInputModes":["text","text/plain"],"defaultOutputModes":["text","text/plain"],"skills":[{"id":"parse_and_chat","name":"Parse and Chat","description":"Parses a file and then chats with a user using the parsed content as context.","tags":["parse","chat","file","llama_parse"],"examples":["What does this file talk about?"]}]}
   =========  starting a new task ======== 

   What do you want to send to the agent? (:q or quit to exit): What does this file talk about?
   Select a file path to attach? (press enter to skip): ./attention.pdf
   ```

## Technical Implementation

- **LlamaIndex Workflows**: Uses a custom workflow to parse the file and then chat with the user
- **Streaming Support**: Provides incremental updates during processing
- **Serializable Context**: Maintains conversation state between turns, can optionally be persisted to redis, mongodb, to disk, etc.
- **Push Notification System**: Webhook-based updates with JWK authentication
- **A2A Protocol Integration**: Full compliance with A2A specifications

## Limitations

- Only supports text-based output
- LlamaParse is free for the first 10K credits (~3333 pages with basic settings)
- Memory is session-based and in-memory, and therefore not persisted between server restarts
- Inserting the entire document into the context window is not scalable for larger files. You may want to deploy a vector DB or use a cloud DB to run retrieval over one or more files for effective RAG. LlamaIndex integrates with a [ton of vector DBs and cloud DBs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/#vector-stores).

You can see that the workflow produced an artifact with in-line citations, and the source text of those citations is included in the metadata of the artifact. If we send more responses in the same session, the agent will remember the previous messages and continue the conversation.
