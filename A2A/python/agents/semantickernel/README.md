# Semantic Kernel Agent with A2A Protocol

This sample demonstrates how to implement a travel agent built on [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/) and exposed through the A2A protocol. It showcases:

- **Multi-turn interactions**: The agent may request clarifications
- **Streaming responses**: Returns incremental statuses
- **Conversational memory**: Maintains context (by leveraging Semantic Kernelâ€™s ChatHistory)
- **Push notifications**: Uses webhook-based notifications for asynchronous updates
- **External plugins (SK Agents & Frankfurter API)**: Illustrates how an Semantic Kernel Agents are used as plugins, along with APIs, that can be called to generate travel plans and fetch exchange rates

    participant Client as A2A Client
    participant Server as A2A Server
    participant TM as TravelManagerAgent 
    participant CE as CurrencyExchangeAgent (Plugin)
    participant AP as ActivityPlannerAgent (Plugin)
    participant API as Frankfurter API (Plugin)

    Client->>Server: Send task (trip query with budget)
    Server->>TM: Forward trip planning query

    Note over TM: Analyze and delegate tasks
    par Currency Exchange Flow
        TM->>CE: How much is $100 USD in KRW?
        CE->>API: Call get_exchange_rate tool
        API->>CE: Return exchange rate
        CE->>TM: Return currency conversion
    and Activity Planning Flow
        TM->>AP: Recommend itinerary for $100 budget
        AP->>TM: Return itinerary recommendations
    end

    TM->>Server: Aggregate currency & itinerary
    Server->>Client: Streaming: "Processing the trip plan (tool calls involved)..."
    Server->>Client: Streaming: "Building the trip plan..."
    Server->>Client: Artifact: Final trip plan with budget details
    Server->>Client: Final status: "Task completed."
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Valid OpenAI/Azure OpenAI or other LLM credentials (depending on your SK setup). See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/ai-services/chat-completion/?tabs=csharp-AzureOpenAI%2Cpython-AzureOpenAI%2Cjava-AzureOpenAI&pivots=programming-language-python#creating-a-chat-completion-service) for more details about Semantic Kernel AI connectors that are used with a ChatCompletionAgent.
- Access to a Frankfurter API key (optional, or you can call the free endpoint)

## Setup & Running

1. **Navigate to the samples directory**:

```bash
cd samples/python/agents/semantickernel
```

2. **Create an environment file (.env) with your API key and the model ID (e.g., "gpt-4.1"):**:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID="your-model-id"
```

3. **Set up the Python Environment**:

> Note: pin the Python version to your desired version (3.10+)

```bash
uv python pin 3.12
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. **Run the agent**:

Choose one of the following options:

> Make sure you run `uv run .` from the following directory: `samples/python/agents/semantickernel`

```bash
# Basic run on default port 10020
uv run .
```
or

```bash
# On custom host/port
uv run . --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

5. **In a separate terminal, run the A2A client:

> Make sure you run `uv run .` from the following directory: `samples/python/hosts/cli`

```bash
cd samples/python/hosts/cli
uv run . --agent http://localhost:10020
```

## Limitations

- Only text-based input/output for now
- Frankfurter API has a limited set of currency conversions
- Session-based memory is ephemeral (in-memory)

## Example Endpoints

You can POST A2A requests to http://localhost:10020 with JSON-RPC specifying tasks/send or tasks/sendSubscribe. Here is a synchronous snippet:

### Request:

POST http://localhost:10020
Content-Type: application/json

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 33,
  "method": "tasks/send",
  "params": {
    "id": "3",
    "sessionId": "1aab49f1e85c499da48c2124f4ceee4d",
    "acceptedOutputModes": ["text"],
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "How much is 1 USD to EUR?" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 33,
  "result": {
    "id": "3",
    "status": {
      "state": "completed",
      "timestamp": "2025-04-01T16:53:29.301828"
    },
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "1 USD is approximately 0.88137 EUR."
          }
        ],
        "index": 0
      }
    ],
    "history": []
  }
}
```

And so on for multi-turn, streaming, etc.
